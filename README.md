# Python & Advent of Code 2022

In this repo I am using the puzzles to learn more about Python.

Highly recommended to check out Advent of Code for yourself:
https://adventofcode.com/

## No Puzzle input in repo

The maker of Advent of Code asked us to not check in the Puzzle inputs.
If you want to run the code, then please go to the page mentioned above and sign in.

Then get your puzzle input for the specific day and create a file named `puzzle_input.txt`
for each day - similar to `test_input.txt`.
